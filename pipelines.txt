JPEG & H264 are both compression methods .
JPEG pipeline sends frame by frame (whole frame is compressed to JPEG image and sent) 
H264 pipeline sends a keyframe initially , and keeps sending just changes in frame , not new whole frames (it calculates the differences between pervious & current frame , and sends the difference) 

This makes JPEG faster as comp in H264 takes the burden of encoding and decoding data and may not be able to cope with the stream
but JPEG takes larger bandwidth


"
In our videostreaming setup between two hosts we already
know what we need our pipeline to do. On the sending side
we need to:
1.
acquire the video data
2.
compress the video data
3.
cut the data into smaller packets
4.
send the packets out through a network transport
On the receiving side we than want to:
1.
receive the packets from the network transport
2.
reassemble the packets into video data
3.
decompress the video data
4.
display the video
